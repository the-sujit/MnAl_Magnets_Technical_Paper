In this Technical Paper, I reviewed the notable literature focusing on L10 phase MnAl Magnets. I elaborated on studies that discuss processing routes, different microstructural defects in the MnAl magnets and its impact on magnetic properties. I concluded the paper with my own take on these studies and possible combination of defects to optimize the candidature of the material as a permanent magnet.
